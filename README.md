# ParkinsonDiseasePrediction
This work aims to develop a Quantum Convolutional Neural Network (QCNN)-based classification model for Parkinson's disease using brain MRI scans. The proposed model will enhance classification accuracy by leveraging QCNN's advanced feature extraction capabilities, outperforming conventional convolutional neural networks.
